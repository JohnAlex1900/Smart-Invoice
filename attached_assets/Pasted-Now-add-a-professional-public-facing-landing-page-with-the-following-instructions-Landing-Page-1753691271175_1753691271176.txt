Now add a professional, public-facing landing page with the following instructions:

🏠 Landing Page Requirements:
Purpose: Introduce the invoicing platform, present the problem, showcase the solution, and attract SME owners to sign up.

📌 Key Sections (scrolling layout):
Hero Section

Headline: “Simplify Your Business Invoicing with One Click”

Subheadline: “A cloud-based invoicing solution tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises.”

CTA Buttons:

"Get Started" → links to /register

"Learn More" → scrolls to Features section

Problem Section

Title: “Why SMEs Struggle with Invoicing”

Bullet points or icons explaining:

Manual errors in Excel or paper invoicing

Time wasted chasing payments

Confusing or expensive tools

Optional: Small infographic or stat highlights (e.g., “35% SME invoicing fails due to poor tools”)

Solution Section

Title: “Our Solution: Cloud-Based Simplicity”

Bullet list or 3-column layout:

Invoice generation in seconds

Secure cloud access 24/7

Payment and client tracking

Mobile-friendly design (optional)

Free forever plan (if applicable)

Benefits for SMEs

Testimonials layout or icons:

“Save 10+ hours/week”

“Track client payments from anywhere”

“Look professional with branded invoices”

Call-to-Action Footer

CTA: “Start Your Free Account Today”

Button: “Create an Account” → /register

🎨 Design Guidelines:
Keep light theme, modern UI (soft blue, gray, white tones)

Use Tailwind CSS cards, shadows, rounded corners

Mobile responsiveness is optional but recommended

Match the style of the internal dashboard

Keep navigation bar with:

Logo placeholder

Nav links: Home | Features | Login | Register

🔒 Access Restriction Logic:
Implement route protection so that:

Only logged-in users can access /dashboard, /invoices, /clients, /settings

All unauthenticated users are redirected to /login if they try to access protected routes

📌 Routing Behavior:
/ → Public Landing Page

/login → Login form (existing)

/register → Register form (existing)

/dashboard, /invoices, /clients, etc. → Accessible only after login

Use React Router and context/Auth hooks or JWT middleware to manage this

End Result:
The landing page should feel like the entry point of a real SaaS platform for SMEs, with clear messaging, visual polish, and seamless transition to signup. It must complement the already existing app features and maintain full functionality.
